# DIYNeoPixelSaber
This is the github for a project I am working on. It is called the NeoPixelSaber.
My goal is to make a lightsaber using arduino, and relativly cheap parts.

## Part List:
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 1x Momentary Push Button
- 1x On/Off button
- 2x 1m 144 NeoPixelStip
- 1x RGB LED
- 1x RJ-45 Plug
- 1x RJ-45 Port
- 1x KnockSwitch Sensor Module
- 1x PowerBank/4 AA battery holder (haven't quite decided yet)
- 1m PP-tube 32mm
- 1m PP-tube 40mm
- 1m polycarbonate tube (May not be ideal, depending on your budget. Will come up with alternatives later)
- TP cable

## Tools:
- Soldering Iron
- Knife
- Saw
- Sandpaper

## Procedure

1. First, you will want to prototype your project. I used a 24 pixel neopixel ring, some buttons and some LEDS. I recomend using an arduino UNO for prototyping, however that is only a personal preference.
2. Then, you will want to write the code for it. Although you can go ahead and use my code, I strongly suggest that you try to write the code yourself. That way, you get a better understanding of how your lightsaber works, as well as the knowlegde of how the code works. It will also then be easier to add features to the code if you know how it functions.
3. Time to design your lightsaber (will update when I get to this step...)
