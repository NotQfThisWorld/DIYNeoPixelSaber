# DIYNeoPixelSaber
This is the github for a project I am working on. It is called the NeoPixelSaber.
My goal was to make a lightsaber using an arduino nano, and relativly cheap parts.

## Part List:
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 2x Momentary Push Button
- 2x Indicator leds (optional, can also be integrated into one of the buttons).
- 1x On/Off switch
- 2x 1m 144LED NeoPixelStip
- Some sort of diffuser. I used bubblewrap, but there are better alternatives.
- 1x Capacitor 1000 ÂµF
- Resistors for both your Strip and you buttons. May vary from product to product.
- 1x Plug with atleast 4 pins.
- 1x 2x2 AA battery holder
- 4x 1,2V rechargable AA-batteries
- 1m PP-tube 32mm (alternatively a 1m polycarbonate tube, if you can afford one)
- 1m PP-tube 40mm
- 1x Sleeve
- TP cable
- Various things for decorating. (Be creative)

## Tools:
- Soldering Iron
- Knife
- Saw
- Sandpaper
- Paint and/or spray-paint

## Suggested Procedure

This is only a brief explination of how I would want to go forward. Be carefull, so that you don't damage any materials or equiment. I take no responsibility for any damaged materials or equipment. Make sure you know what you are doing.

   --Hilt--
1. First, you will want to prototype your project. I used a 24 pixel neopixel ring, some buttons and some LEDS. I recomend using an arduino UNO for prototyping, for easy connectivity, however that is only a personal preference.
2. Then, you will want to write the code for it. Although you can go ahead and use my code, I strongly suggest that you try to write the code yourself. That way, you get a better understanding of how your lightsaber works, as well as the knowlegde of how the code works. It will also then be easier to add features to the code if you know how it functions. (+ that my code is terrible).
No need to write the full code now, you can adjust it as you go.
3. Time to design your lightsaber. Make drawings. Go for a walk in a hardwars store. Be creative.
4. By the materials you need. You can of course buy the materials as you go too.
6. Cut the PP-Tubes up into reasonable lengths. I went for 25cm for the main hilt, and 5cm for shroud. Then I used a sleeve, that I sanded down, to connect the two parts together. The blade should be between 0,8M and 1M long.
7. Make the electronics compartment. I used a 2x2 AA batteryholder as my starting point. I attached a plate to the back of the holder, to hold the Arduino and the electronics. I added a couple of empty scotch tape rolls to it to make it so that the electronics compartment would fit nicely inside the hilt.
8. Plan where you want to lead the cables.
9. Start soldering. Make sure you have enough length on each wire (better safe than sorry) and that the wires are drawn trough any holes or channels that you want them to go through.

   --Blade--
11. Cut the strips to length. Glue the two strips together, back to back. Solder the connections to the plug. Add a capasitor between the + and -. 
12. Find a way to make the electronics part of the strip fit snuggly into the bottom of the blade. I used a small sleeve with electrical tape around. Make also sure that the "dark" electronics part of the blade is hidden when you put it into the hilt.
13. Find something to put on the end of the blade. I used a pice of white PE-foam (you often find them protecting electronics like screens). However, this gave me a bit of a flat tip. Try to find something cone-shaped. Also, by sanding down the blade, you can allow more light through, which makes for a brighter blade
14. To be continued...
